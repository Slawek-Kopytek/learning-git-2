        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <span>by 2Pac</span><br><br>
        <p>Come on come on I see no changes.<br>
        Wake up in the morning and I ask myself, "Is life worth living?<br>
        Should I blast myself?" I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.<br>
        My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.<br>
        Cops give a damn about a negro?<br> 
        Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.<br> 
        Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares?<br> 
        One less hungry mouth on the welfare.<br> 
        First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.<br> 
        Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.<br> 
        "It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said.<br> 
        2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.<br> 
        I got love for my brother,<br>
        but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other.<br>
        We gotta start makin' changes.<br> 
        Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.<br> 
        And that's how it's supposed to be.<br> 
        How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?<br> 
        I'd love to go back to when we played as kids but things changed,<br>
        and that's the way it is<br><br>
